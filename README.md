# polymer-classification

## Background

Polymeric materials are uqiquitous in our world and nearly every industry. Materials are selected based on physical, mechanical, thermal, and economic characteristics for any given application. Polymers as a class of materials have an extremely wide range of potential properties, from relatively soft low-density polyethylene (LDPE) to extremely strong and rigid engineering polymers such as Kevlar (Polyaramid) or PEEK. In addition to broad classifications such as thermoplastic, elastomer, and thermosets, many polymers can be classified by their polymer subclass or specific chemical composition of the repeat unit. This is often how we think of plastics, with symbols like PP (polypropylene), PET (polyester terepthalate) and  (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene). The goal of this project is classify polymer materials into their respective polymer subclass using point mechanical data as features. Examples of these mechanical properties include tensile strengh at break, izod impact, flexural modulus, and elongation at break. Other physical properties may also be used as features â€“ such as density, melt flow rate, etc.
